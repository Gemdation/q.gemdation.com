<h2>Wiimmfi Rule Booklet</h2>
<p>Wiimmfi enforces a tiered system of bans comprising eight distinct durations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>3-Minute Ban</li>
    <li>1-Hour Ban
    <li>6-Hour Ban</li>
    <li>24-Hour Ban</li>
    <li>1-Week Ban</li>
    <li>2-Week Ban</li>
    <li>4-Week Ban</li>
    <li>Permanent Ban</li>
</ul>
<p>For each transgression, a first offense incurs a specific base ban duration. In the event of a subsequent offense, the ban duration escalates to the next higher tier. It is important to note that these regulations are specifically tailored to Mario Kart Wii, given its status as the most prevalent game on Wiimmfi. However, similar principles may apply to other supported games.</p>
<p>To report individuals who violate the established rules, please proceed to post a comment in the current About banning thread in the following forum board, making sure you provide enough proof and information:<br>
    <a>https://forum.wii-homebrew.com/index.php/Board/357-Wiimmfi-English</a><br>
    Alternatively, if you possess contact with a Wiimmfi moderator, you may directly provide them the necessary information.</p>
<h2>Mii Names and Faces</h2>
<p>Mii names and faces featuring inappropriate topics that contravene the "E for Everyone" rating will incur bans. Such prohibited content encompasses hate speech, sexual themes, derogatory language, and related material. It is crucial to emphasize that this policy does not extend to private rooms, unless a name poses a threat to a participant without their consent, particularly in Open Host rooms where unrestricted access is granted to all players. It is also worth noting that Mii names may not exceed 10 characters.</p>
<p>The utilization of the following characters in the Mii name is also prohibited to mitigate the risk of disrupting or tampering with the stats page. Their usage in friend rooms is also disallowed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ô∑Ω</li>
    <li>íê´</li>
    <li>íàô</li>
    <li>‚∏ª</li>
    <li>ÍßÖ</li>
    <br>
    <li>·Ä™</li>
    <li>‡Øµ</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>Note:</u></b> any other character not explicitly listed here that also breaks or interferes with the stats page is also subject to a ban.</p>
<p>Inclusion of hacked symbols within your Mii name will not result in a ban.</p>
<p>When reporting Mii names, it is sufficient to provide the player's Friend Code or Profile ID, both of which are accessible via https://wiimmfi.de/stats/mkw. In instances where Mii names incorporate symbols not viewable on the stats page, it is advisable to provide at least a screenshot captured in-game as supporting evidence. For Mii faces, submission of either a screenshot or video proof is mandatory for the reporting process.</p>
<h2>Trolling and disruptive play</h2>
<p>Engaging in the practice of deliberately driving backwards to disrupt other players with items is strictly prohibited.</p>

<p>The act commonly referred to as Stop Trolling, defined as deliberately decelerating while utilizing a power item such as a Star or Mega Mushroom to strike a player positioned behind, is permissible. This strategic maneuver serves the purpose of neutralizing potential threats, such as evading a player armed with Triple Red Shells, and is thus allowed.</p>

<p>However, repeatedly engaging in the act of Stop Trolling against a particular player over consecutive instances, deliberately reversing course momentarily to target them, or repeatedly striking an individual with a Star power-up in quick succession is prohibited.</p>

<p>Intentionally halting and/or performing bike dances before reaching the finish line in public rooms with the intention of allowing another player to secure victory are deemed disruptive behaviors and are therefore discouraged. It is advisable to refrain from engaging in such practices.</p>

<p>Engaging in intentional actions that result in losing races or disrupting the gameplay experience for others is strictly prohibited. This includes deliberately altering the standard mechanics of the game by imposing self-handicaps that ensure defeat or interfere with other players. Examples of such behavior include limiting the use of essential controller functions, playing while blindfolded, driving exclusively in reverse, or any similar actions that compromise the integrity of the game.</p>

<p>Worldwide, Regional, and CTWW races adhere to the same set of rules against trolling. However, Countdown and Battle modes feature distinct definitions, as outlined in their respective sections below.</p>

<p>To report any instance of trolling or disruptive play, it is necessary to provide the player's Friend Code or Profile ID, accessible via <a href="stats/mkv">wiimmfi.de/stats/mkw</a>, along with a recording documenting the incident.</p>
