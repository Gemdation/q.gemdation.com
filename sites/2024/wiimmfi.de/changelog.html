<dt class="changelog">MASTER:</dt>
<dd>

	The MASTER server is now implemented as single thread tool in C
	(multi process netcat/PHP before).
	It is fast enough to handle the UDP packets of more than 20000 clients.
	<p>
	The new MASTER needs much less resources (one thread, &lt;6 MB RSS).
	But the main advantage is, that no more packets are lost and that the generic
	game table members are now handled much better (no issues known).
	
</dd><dt class="changelog">Login Statistics &amp; MAC changer:</dt>
<dd>

	The login statistics to detect the abuse using of Wii identifiers
	were changed and reset with this update.
	So people, who had <i>accidental</i> used a MAC changer,
	have now a second chance to use Wiimmfi.
	Best is to avoid cheats and to deactivate all tricky tools,
	because if the system detects this kind of manipulation
	it bans you automatically.

<dt class="changelog">MASTER:</dt>
<dd>

	Split incoming data into multiple packets.
	This repairs a PHP issue, that combines multiple packets into one data packet.
	This issue was also a problem for the generic MS table expansion.
	
</dd><dt class="changelog">MASTER:</dt>
<dd>

	If a "name=value" pair is send twice with the same name,
	the first value is used to fill the MS table.
	Before the later one overrode the previous values.
	This fix a problem of <i>We love Golf</i>.
	
</dd><dt class="changelog">MASTER:</dt>
<dd>

	Wait a few seconds for more incoming packets before closing the thread.
	This is an optimization (less threads and lower chance to lost a packet,
	that arrives while closing).

	Micro sleep between packets to the same client added

<dd>

	New kind of friend list management without database support:
	<ul class="narrow">
	<li>The problem of the old system:
	    If a player connected the first time to the new server after as databse reset,
	    other people don't see him until they reconnect to WFC.
	    This is solved by the new system.
	<li>The new system can be enabled game by game.
	<li>At the moment it is only enabled for MKWii.
	    It works, because MKWii sends always the complete friend list on logon.
	<li>Server GPSP supports now the new kind of friend list management.
	    The only DB lookup is a search in the retrieved and created friend-nick tables.
