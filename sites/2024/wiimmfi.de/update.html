<h1>Required Wiimmfi Patcher update for games other than Mario Kart Wii</h2>

<div class="text-help">
<p>
<i>This page contains information about the newly required patcher update in 2021.
If you are looking for information about the Mario Kart Wii patcher update that
was released in November 2018, please check <a href="update2018">this page</a> instead.</i></div>

<div class=text>
<h2>What this is about</h2>

Back in November 2018, there was a mandatory patcher update for Mario
Kart Wii, where we released new patchers for Mario Kart Wii that fixed
a couple security issues in the game, and added an auto-update feature
that allows us to add future features and fixes to the game easily. 

<p>
Unfortunately, we only have that kind of auto-updating for Mario Kart Wii.

<p>
We've now found a similar security issue that seems to be present in most 
Wii games. We already fixed that issue in Mario Kart Wii with our auto-updater,
but we can't do that for other games. Thus, we have created new Wiimmfi patchers
for all Wii games. These new patchers will be required for all games that do have
this security issue.

<p>
These patchers will only fix this specific security issue, they will not add
an auto-update feature to all games like the one we currently have for Mario Kart Wii.

<p>If you are <b>ONLY</b> playing <b>Mario Kart Wii</b> online, you will not need this update - 
Mario Kart can update itself when you connect to Wiimmfi. If you want to play
<b>most other Wii games</b> on Wiimmfi, you will need to update your patchers.

<p>However, in addition to these security fixes, most of the new patchers come with other features
as well, so even if you are just playing Mario Kart Wii it might be worth
it to update your patchers, though it is not required to do so:

<ul>
<li>Features / bugfixes for the Disc Patcher, FlashHax and str2hax only:</li>
	<ul>
                <li>Support for UPnP in Mario Kart Wii (all regions), SSBB (PAL and USA),
                        and Animal Crossing (PAL and USA) has been added, which improves the connection quality / stability.</li>
		<li>Games will now run under their proper IOS.
			That means USB compatibility in games started through these patchers should now be better.
			If you had problems with your USB keyboard in games like Animal Crossing, that should now be fixed.</li>
		<li>There was a bug that sometimes caused out-of-region games to not boot correctly, that
			bug is now fixed in the new version of the patchers.</li>
		<li>Compatibility with unreliable disc drives improved - instead of hanging when it can't read the disc
			properly, the patcher now correctly retries to read the disc. Also, it no longer crashes if you
			insert the disc the wrong way.</li>
		<li>Starting Mario Kart Wii through these patchers will allow you to enable competitions in the game settings,
			which previously just caused an empty message box to show up (also included in the brainslug module).
			The <a href="https://competitions.wiimmfi.de/">competition patcher</a> is still needed to use competitions though. </li>
		<li>Mario Kart Wii has a bug that sometimes causes error 5142x on the first connection after
                	a reboot when using a LAN adapter - with the new patchers this should no longer happen. (Also included in the brainslug module)</li>

	</ul>
<li>Feature for all patchers except Priiloader & USB Loaders: A couple patches by InvoxiPlayGames are included in order to make the following games playable online again:
			<ul>
			<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops</li>
			<li style="margin-top: 0px">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Reflex</li>
			<li style="margin-top: 0px">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</li>
			<li style="margin-top: 0px">Call of Duty: World At War</li>
			<li style="margin-top: 0px">Rock Band 3</li>
			<li style="margin-top: 0px">The Beatles: Rock Band</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note: Playing any of these games will connect to the original game servers; and playing Call of Duty: World At War will additionally also connect
			to a <a>custom server operated by InvoxiPlayGames</a>.</li>
                        Neither of these servers are hosted or controlled by the Wiimmfi team, and we are not responsible for anything that happens on these servers.
</li>

<li>Bugfixes for the ISO / WBFS patcher only:
<ul>
	<li>Updated a few BMG messages where "Nintendo WFC" wasn't replaced by "Wiimmfi" previously.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where the patcher wouldn't always work correctly on MacOS.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</div>

<div class=text id="whatnow">
<h2>What you need to do now</h2>

The Wiimmfi server will now only allow connections from updated games.
This means, if you don't update your game, you will no longer be able to access
Wiimmfi in most games and will see an error message (error 23904) when trying to connect.

<p>
To continue using Wiimmfi in all games (<b>Mario Kart Wii will continue to work
without a new patch</b>, same for a few other games), please check the following list:
<ul>
<li>
  If you are using <b>the FlashHax page</b> in the Internet Channel (on <tt>http://chadsoft.co.uk/wiimmfi</tt>), or
  <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><b>the str2hax EULA exploit</b></span> using the license agreement menu, you don't need to do anything.
  These patchers have automatically been updated.
<li>
  If you are using your <b>USB Loaders custom server patch</b>, you'll have to update your USB Loader.
  You can download the updated WiiFlow Lite (5.4.9 or newer) from <a>its Github page</a>, 
  and you can download the updated USB-Loader GX (r1272mod6 or newer) from <a>this GBAtemp post</a>.
  If you don't want to update your USB Loader or you're using a different USB Loader, you can also use the ISO patchers to patch your game images for Wiimmfi. 
<li>
  If you are using a <b>patched WBFS or ISO image</b>, you need to download the new
  patcher and re-patch your image: <a href="../download.wiimmfi.de/patcher">Download</a>
<li>
  If you are using the <b>Homebrew "Auto Wiimmfi Patcher"</b> for discs,
  you need to download the new patcher: <a href="../download.wiimmfi.de/patcher">Download</a>
<li>
  If you are using <b>any Riivolution package</b> to connect to Wiimmfi,
  you will need to wait for its creator to release an update,
  or switch to another supported method.
<li>
  If you are using <b>Priiloader v0.9's Wiimmfi patch</b>, please download the updated <a>hacks_hash.ini file</a> 
  and replace the one currently on your SD card, then enable the "Wiimmfi Patch v4" hack in Priiloader.
<li>
  If you are a developer and you are using <b>Chadderz' Brainslug channel</b> with your own
  modules, you can download this updated brainslug module that includes all the Wiimmfi patches: <a>Download</a>
<li>
  If you're receiving error 23904 in a <b>WiiWare game</b>, please download the most recent version of RiiConnect24's <a>
  Auto WiiWare Patcher</a> and re-patch your WiiWare game. 
<li>
  If you are playing games on other servers like <b>AltWFC</b>, this new update is not required.
  However, there still is the risk of hackers breaking your Wii when you use these unpatched servers,
  unless the AltWFC server devs also release such an update. 
</ul>

<div class=text>
<h2>If something doesn't work</h2>

<p>If you receive error code 23904, you either haven't re-patched your game, 
or the patch didn't work properly. Try patching your game again.</p>

<p>If the patcher shows an error message during patching / booting, that's 
probably a bug with the patcher. Please let us know what game you tried to boot
and we will try to fix it.</p>

<p>If the Disc Patcher gets stuck while using UPnP (the last displayed line
will be something like "add UPnP port forward") for more than 10 seconds, 
there might be an incompatibility with the UPnP code. Try restarting the patcher
and press B when asked to disable UPnP. Please also let us know about the issue
and tell us what router you have, so we can try to fix the issue.</p>

<p>If the Disc Patcher crashes with a DSI exception (a bunch of weird
letters and numbers on the screen), please take a readable photo of that
screen and send the photo to Leseratte so we can figure out why that crash
happened and how to fix it.</p>

<p>If you receive unusual error codes other than 23XXX, or your console
freezes during connecting, we might currently do some changes to the server,
please try again in a couple minutes.</p>

<p>If you still can't connect to Wiimmfi, please check the related thread in the
Wii-Homebrew.com forums — <a>click</a> — and make a post there.
Make sure to include as much information as possible
(Game name + region, approximate time, used Patcher, console serial number, error code)
to help us find out why the error happens.</p>
